# 02450 Machine Learning & Data Mining Course contents

## Learning Objectives:

* A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:
* Describe the major steps involved in data modeling from preparing the data, modeling the data to evaluating and disseminating the results.
* Discuss key machine learning concepts such as feature extraction, cross-validation, generalization and over-fitting, prediction and curse of dimensionality.
* Sketch how the data modeling methods work and describe their assumptions and limitations.
* Match practical problems to standard data modeling problems such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and association mining.
* Apply the data modeling framework to a broad range of application domains in medical engineering, bio-informatics, chemistry, electrical engineering and computer science.
* Compute the results of the data modeling framework by use of Matlab, R or Python.
* Use visualization techniques and statistics to evaluate model performance, identify patterns and data issues.
* Combine and modify data modeling tools in order to analyze a data set of their own and disseminate the results of the analysis
